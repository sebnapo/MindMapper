          "note":"&ldquo;Getting an education at MIT is like trying to drink from a firehose.&rdquo; &mdash; folk saying&nbsp;The Torch or The Firehose: A Guide to Section Teaching, by MIT Mathematics Professor Arthur Mattuck, is a guide to recitation teaching at MIT. During a typical recitation section, a teaching assistant (TA) meets with a small group of students to review the most recent lecture, expand on the concepts, work through practice problems, and conduct a discussion with the students. With good humor and sound advice, Professor Mattuck offers both novice and seasoned recitation instructors guidelines on how sections can best serve as a complement to lectures, how to help students become better learners, and how to enjoy their experience as recitation teachers. Lecturers claim they have learned something from it, too. This content was first published as a printed booklet in 1981. This is the second edition. It has had a wide distribution, both at MIT and other universities, since it first appeared. It is finally available in digital format to allow broader distribution and use of this valuable material.

Currently the best performing methods at this task are based on engineered descriptors with explicit local geometric cues and other heuristics. Until very recently, learning has not played a major role until the classification stage, at which point much of the input is lost. It has been shown that learning features in a supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised setting can improve performance in other vision tasks, but most of these works have concentrated on static images rather than video. In this tutorial, we will review a number of recently proposed methods that attempt to learn low and mid-level features for use in activity recognition. This includes deep and unsupervised feature learning methods such as convolutional networks, convolutional deep belief networks and other approaches which learn sparse, overcomplete representations.",

Unfortunately, this wealth of data remains inaccessible to those without in-depth knowledge of semantic technologies. We describe a toolchain enabling users without semantic technology background to explore and visually analyse Linked Data. We demonstrate its applicability in scenarios involving data from the Linked Open Data Cloud, and research data extracted from scienti_c publications. Our focus is on the Web-based front-end consisting of querying and visualisation tools. The performed usability evaluations unveil mainly positive results confirming that the Query Wizard simplifies searching, refining and transforming Linked Data and, in particular, that people using the Visualisation Wizard quickly learn to perform interactive analysis tasks on the resulting Linked Data sets. In making Linked Data analysis effectively accessible to the general public, our tool has been integrated in a number of live services where people use it to analyse, discover and discuss facts with Linked Data.\r\n",
